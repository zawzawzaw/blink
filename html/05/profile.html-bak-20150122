								<h3>about blink</h3>
								<p>We’re different from other design firms. While the quality of our work speaks for itself, we make our case for design greatness one story at a time. We are committed to design excellence in the context of collaboration. These are our guiding principles throughout the design process.</p>
								<p>Our design is intended to be welcoming, centered on the uniqueness of a specific location. We explore vernacular style, history, and culture as rich sources of ideas — our designs are always authentic and in harmony with their surroundings.</p>
								<p>BLINK lives and breaths Asia, with offices in Bangkok, Singapore, New Delhi, and Shanghai. We are international, with projects from Istanbul to Bora Bora, the Maldives to Seoul. And we are citizens of the world — multi-lingual and multi-cultural, representing six of the seven continents.</p>

He also believes that the genius loci — the spirit of a place revealed in the culture, history, and vernacular style — will lead to exceptional design and truly transformational experiences. <br /><br /> These convictions are visible throughout BLINK’s growing portfolio, from smart, midscale, urban hotels to resorts at the upper reaches of luxury in some of the world’s most desired destinations. Clint has spent more than two decades at design’s cutting edge, exploring space, testing limits, and winning accolades along the way. He trusts his instincts, and our clients do, too. <br /><br /> Perhaps Clint’s greatest contribution as Chief Creative Director is his belief that collaboration at the highest level creates a framework for success. His close relationships with clients and operators, combined with the youthful energy of the BLINK design team and expertise that comes from experience, all lead to design that is seasoned with subtle touches, grand flourishes, and a harmony between form and function that will stay with a hotel guest long after check-out.

She believes that space is experienced not only through the eyes, but also through other senses such as touch and smell, as well as more abstract conceptual elements such as atmosphere or impression.<br><br>One of Mook’s convictions is that design is an experience that gets richer and fuller with time, as design challenges are met and overcome, resulting in successful creations. Mook has fulfilled these goals as a designer on projects such as the Hilton Hotel, Dali, China; the Hyatt Regency Hotel, Fuzhou, China; the Westin Hotel, Jakarta; and the Royal Orchid Sheraton or Radisson Suites in Bangkok, Thailand. <br><br>As Studio Director, Mook will leverage her talent to strengthen and lead Blink’s Bangkok office to be one of the premier design studios in Asia."><span>Mook Lindsay</span></a>

He taps his vast reservoir of knowledge in master planning, design, and detailing to prepare concept presentations and design documentation before segueing into site visits and construction administration.<br><br>More than two decades as an architect has taken him the length and breadth of South East Asia, as well as Mexico and Australia.

He believes that good hotel design should transcend the purely aesthetic to a realm where space, form, intimacy, grandeur, senses, and technology offer holistic, living respite for guests.<br><br>Christopher believes that a deep understanding of the vernacular is the key to truly sustainable design — that time-honored wisdom on elemental forces like air- and water-flow should be heeded, rather than ignored — that the local landscape, climate, and above all, the people and their culture, inform good design. <br><br>As a Managing Director, he achieves exceptional results by motivating those around him — collaborating with clients and leading by example. He begins each design, no matter how grand or how humble, with a master plan. It’s all part of the brainstorming process, which is where the magic happens. 'We work as a team,' he says, 'to find something that rings true in everyone’s hearts.' It’s a journey into the nuances and details that make a particular site, destination, city, and culture tick, and that shape and define a vision. "><span>Christopher Chua</span></a>

He is also a sought-after designer who has worked on the private homes of more than a dozen of Bangkok’s high-society movers and shakers.<br><br>Ong-art shares BLINK’s veneration of the vernacular, but he refuses to let his designs be determined by place alone, mining inspiration from across the spectrum of the creative arts — from cinema and fashion to painting, photography, and beyond.<br><br>In his early career at Bunnag Architects International, Ong-Art worked on ultra-luxury villas at Malaiwana Phuket and the world’s first Ritz-Carlton Reserve at Phulay Bay, Krabi.
